# NGS-plugins [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NGSNetwork/sm-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NGSNetwork/sm-plugins)
Plugins for NGS. All of these are free for anyone to do (almost) anything anywhere for any reason with under the Unlicense license. Just check the license for details. If any plugins were released with their own license, LICENSE does not overwrite it. Use that one instead, for all cases.
